## Submission Instructions

### Overview
You've just arrived in St. Louis for a conference, or you just moved here, and you're hungry. You heard there's some great food here, but you have no idea where to find it. Imagine if you could pull up an app on your phone and search for your favorite food, the nearest restaurants to where you're staying, or the best vegan options around? 

STL Food Finder is the app you need. STL Food Finder lists 100 of the best restaurants in St. Louis by category, neighborhod and price. Search to find what you're looking for, or use the map to locate the nearest restaurants to you at a glance. 

I wanted to build STL Food Finder because I've had my fair share of disappointing first meals in cities around the world. I've experienced that frustration of knowing a city must have so many good places to eat, but I just don't know where they are. STL Food Finder puts local expertise in your hands so you can find restaurants you'll love just like we do.
